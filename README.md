ProtoSat Computing Projects for IrishSat 2023-2024

Collaborative base for developing Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS), which include Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for state estimation. 

Iterative development model: members apply their unique technical background in tandem with their peers to fulfil requirements set out by the greater ProtoSat team. 

Members: make sure to clone the repository and work on a feature-branch, not on main!
