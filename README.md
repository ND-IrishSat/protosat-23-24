ProtoSat Computing Projects for IrishSat 2023-2024

Collaborative base for developing Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS), which include Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for state estimation. 

Iterative development model: members apply their unique technical background in tandem with their peers to fulfil requirements set out by the greater ProtoSat team. 

Members: make sure to clone the repository and work on a feature-branch, not on main!

For PySOL repo: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules
- Files from external repository will not be included, need to manually download them to your local repository
- If newly cloning this repository, and want to add all the files from the PySOL submodule (repository), run the following instead of normal git clone: "git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ND-IrishSat/protosat-23-24.git"
